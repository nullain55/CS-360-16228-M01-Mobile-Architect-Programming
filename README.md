Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The inventory app I developed for Donkey Fit LLC is designed to streamline inventory management for an apparel business. Core features include user account creation, secure login, and comprehensive inventory tracking. 
The app supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing inventory data, enabling users to add, update, and delete items as needed. It also includes a notification system that sends SMS alerts for low-stock items. The app's grid-based interface provides a clear, organized view of inventory levels, helping users efficiently monitor stock. Additionally, role-based access ensures that both administrators and warehouse staff have the appropriate permissions for their tasks.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To meet user needs and design a user-centered interface for the Donkey Fit LLC inventory app, several key screens and features were required. 
The login screen ensured secure access for different user roles, including administrators and warehouse staff, by implementing username and password authentication for proper validation.
The inventory management screen featured a grid-based display, allowing users to easily view, add, edit, and delete inventory items. 
Additionally, the app incorporated a low-stock alert system through SMS notifications, enabling users to stay informed and take proactive measures to replenish inventory as needed.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached the coding process for the Donkey Fit LLC inventory app by breaking the development into manageable stages, prioritizing core functionality before refining the design.
I began by establishing the app’s basic structure, focusing on user authentication, database management, and CRUD operations. Using an iterative development approach, I implemented small pieces of functionality, thoroughly tested each, and refined them before progressing to the next feature. This method allowed me to maintain focus on stability and quality throughout the development process.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

To ensure the functionality of my code, I used a combination of unit testing, manual testing, and real-device testing through Android Studio’s Emulator. 
I started by testing individual components like user authentication and CRUD operations to verify that each function worked as intended. This included checking edge cases such as incorrect login credentials, missing input fields, and invalid data entries to ensure robustness. Additionally, I tested the app’s performance across various screen sizes and resolutions to confirm that the UI remained responsive and user-friendly.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When designing or developing a project, the key challenge is determining what functionalities are core to the project and what can be added in future iterations. 
The core functionality should be considered the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—the essential features that ensure the project fulfills its basic purpose. Everything else can be treated as future enhancements.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

In my mobile app project, I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience through the implementation of the inventory management system. 
This component required the effective use of RecyclerView with a GridLayoutManager to display inventory data dynamically. I applied CRUD operations with an SQLite database, allowing users to efficiently add, update, delete, and retrieve inventory items. 
Additionally, the integration of SMS notifications to alert users about low stock levels showcased my ability to manage Android permissions and enhance user experience by providing real-time notifications.
